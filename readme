D4os is a set of modules to manage an OpenSim grid using drupal.
more infos : http://groups.drupal.org/d4os

***** ⚠ Actually d4os is using the OpenSim 0.6.8 database schema ⚠ *****

****************
Installation :
****************
  * install OpenSim in grid mode using mysql as datastore
  * if you want to use search and groups, use the link http://d4os.yourdomain.com/services/xmlrpc in your OpenSim.ini [search] and [groups] section
  * if your database is not the same as the website one, you need to modify the file "sites/default/settings.php" (see below)
  * extract the archive in your drupal modules folder (sites/all/modules)
  * go to you modules admin page and enable the modules (admin/build/modules)
  * go to the d4os admin pages and set the values to fit your OpenSim installation (admin/settings/d4os)
  * if using the database module, you need to configure the databases urls (admin/settings/d4os/io/db)

****************
dependencies :
****************
  * you can use the search and groups services independantly
  * but if you want to use the groups in the website, you need to install the module called "og" (http://drupal.org/project/og)
  * if you want to use the events in the website, you need to install the module called "date-api" (http://drupal.org/project/date)

*********************
drupal settings.php
*********************
  * to use the OpenSim databases, drupal needs to know where they are
  * you need to fill your drupal settings.php file with these infos
  * $db_url['default'] is the drupal website database url

---------------------------------------
same database for website and drupal :
---------------------------------------
$db_url = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/mybase';
$db_prefix = '';

---------------------------------------
different databases :
---------------------------------------
$db_url['default'] = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/mybase';
$db_prefix['default'] = '';
