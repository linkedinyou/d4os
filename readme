D4os is a set of modules to manage an OpenSim grid using drupal.

***** THIS IS AN ALPHA STAGE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK AND NOT IN A PRODUCTION SITE *****

I recommend you to not use d4os profiles, search and group modules (except the ui ones) because if your website is down, the profiles / search and groups will not be available inworld !!!

actually (feb 2012) im rewriting all the module and i have removed all of them to focus on user registration and management so please be patient.
the next release will not be compatible with simiangrid (for the moment) and will not be compatible with opensim < 0.7.1 (it will be a big cleaning)

****************
Installation :
****************
  * install OpenSim in grid mode using mysql as datastore
  * if you want to use search, profile and groups, you need to import the sql files from these modules in your database (d4os is not creating these tables. The sql files can be found in their own projects on the OpenSim forge)
  * if you want to use search, profile and groups, use the link http://d4os.yourdomain.com/services/xmlrpc in your OpenSim.ini [search] [profile] and [groups] sections
  * extract the archive in your drupal modules folder (sites/all/modules)
  * go to you modules admin page and enable the modules (admin/build/modules)
  * go to the d4os admin pages and set the values to fit your OpenSim installation (admin/settings/d4os)
  * if using the database module, you need to configure the databases urls (admin/settings/d4os/io/db)

****************
dependencies :
****************
  * you can use the search and groups services independantly (io), but to use them, you need to install the module called "services" and enable "xmlrpc server" (http://drupal.org/project/services)
  * if you want to use the groups in the website (ui), you need to install the module called "og" (http://drupal.org/project/og)
  * if you want to use the events in the website, you need to install the module called "date-api" (http://drupal.org/project/date)
  * if you want to use the stats levels, you need to install the module called "libraries" (http://drupal.org/project/libraries)
